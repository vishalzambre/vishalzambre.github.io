To verify your site with Google Search Console:

1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Add your property (vishalzambre.com)
3. Choose "HTML file" verification method
4. Google will provide you with a verification file like: google1234567890abcdef.html
5. Create a new file in the root directory with that exact name
6. Upload this file to verify ownership

After verification, you can:
- Submit your sitemap (https://vishalzambre.com/sitemap.xml)
